R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.1 and R development
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win-Builder.

This submission imports functions from default R packages other than 
base used in this package. In addition, there are other fixes, including
for changes in httr v1. 

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
