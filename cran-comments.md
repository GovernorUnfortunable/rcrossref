R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.1.2 and R development 
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

I submitted this previously on 2014-10-15, but was told to submit a new 
version of spocc first, another pakage I maintain, that used this package. 
A new version of spocc was submitted, so I am now resubmitting the same 
version of rgbif.

Note that CRAN checks may fail on Mavericks because there appears to be
no Mavericks binaries available for two dependencies: rgdal and rgeos.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
